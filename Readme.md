## Synopsis

Tetwis is a mobile game that is similar to Tetris, but includes physics calculations. It is built using Unity and so it can be distributed to multiple platforms, such as iOS, Android, PC, etc, but this project includes the Android build. 

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

This project is based off the game "Tricky Towers" which is for PS4 and Steam. We wanted to create a Tetris game for the mobile platform that also included physics calculations. This was also a good way to get a good introduction into game development for the Android and iOS platform.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.
